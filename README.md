This horizontal bar chart is constructed from a CSV file storing the judgements of the Supreme Court of Nigeria from 1961 to 2022. The chart employs conventional margins and a number of D3 features:

d3-dsv - load and parse data
d3-scale - x- and y-position
d3-group - map data keys to the corresponding array of values
d3-rollup - uses reduce to compute and map keys to corresponding value sum or count
d3-union - returns unique keys from an array
d3-array - compute simple statistics (e.g., max)
d3-axis - display axes
d3-shape - computed stacked positions
